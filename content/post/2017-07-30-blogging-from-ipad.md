#Writing from the iPad

This Is a simple test: can I get a decent workflow for writing using my iPad?

Can I embed a tweet?

Probably soo. The cool thing is that even that tweet embedd code was written using the `Workflow` app and a custom action. Brilliant!

Next up, have `Working Copy`push it to me repo, so `Heroku`can pick it up and have it displayed!
