Ever since I joined 8th Light 4 years ago as an apprentice, our apprenticeship has slightly changed.
Someitmes it had to adapt to the needs of the mentor being on client site most of the week.
Or it had to adjust to the skills and talents the apprentice brought with them.
Most of these adjustments have not touched the fundamental formula of the apprenticeship though.
As such, some aspects feel dusted and dated.
I have an idea for some broader changes, that in hindsight, will just make more explict what to implicitly do already.

# Perceived changes and new challenges

Before we go into I feel we could do better, it is important to understand some of the short comings that have been reported by apprentices and mentors a like.

For apprentices a big issue is the anxiety due to uncertainty they face around the apprenticeship.
This revolves around questions like "Am I learning fast enough?" or "What are milestones I need to complete before my graduation?" and "What will I be doing next week?". 
There is also uncertainty in the individual tasks and exercises they are asked to do.
I have often heared apprentices wondering what _really_ they should be getting from an exercise, or complaints that they don't _really_ know what they are supposed to do.
These things make the apprenticeship harder and more insecure, but also means that given the apprentice graduates, they will not be 100% confident _why_ they did certain things.
Cargo cuting mentors are the product of this uncertainty.

For mentors, life isn't any easier.
They need to balance the everyday client struggles with finding time and space to mentor their apprentice(s).
Most of our mentors are now onsite at a client engagement and as such weekly check-ins are done either remotely, later in the day after an extra commute, or crammed into a busy Friday afternoon.
This leaves very little leeway to find the right exercise that will push and challenge the apprentices to gain new insights.
Unless there is some strong will, there is a good chance mentors will fall back to exercises and reading material from their own apprenticeship.

# Explicit is the new implict!

During the apprenticeship, there are a few things we need to keep in balance:

* Everybody should have the same introduction into the company. This includes things like getting an email address, signing into Slack, and creating a Pull Request to add themselves to our website.
 But there is more, which not every mentor is aware of as things have been changing. From an admin site we need to make sure they sign our employee handbook, have access to our time off tracker, are made aware of our code of conduct, and know where to book time off. 
 There are also values and principles _of the apprenticeship itself_ that need to be conveyed, such as asking for help and providing it, learning to handle ambiguity, regular writing and why, etc.

* Every apprentice is different, comes form a different background, and has a different trajectory. Realizing this means that we need to be able to tailor each apprenticeship to the apprentice and their learning style.

* We have a common, shared set of values that we want all our graduating crafters to live up to. Throughout their apprenticeship we need to ensure to instill these, no matter what path they take on.

A lot of this _implicit_ today.
For example, it takes apprentices weeks or months to get on the site, because its considered more of a side-task.
Also, not all apprentices are aware of our sick-time policy, as it was only introduced recently (but is probably in the staff handbook).
Finally, the position we take on as crafters - whether leaning more towards a consultant/coach or highly skilled engineer - is also not settled (not that it needs to!) and leads to quetsions towards the end of the apprenticeship. 

The best way I can see this working is in making more and more of the apprenticeship explict, somehow codefied.
The trick will be to make it codified, but flexible.
Broadly applicable, but custom for each apprentice.


# An app for mentors



# Surface learning vs Deep learning

(_John Biggs_)
People develop different learning styles
There are two broad learning styles, surface and deep learning.

Students who adopt a surface learning style study to earn a qualification for a job, putting in sufficient effort to pass an exam and stay out of trouble.
These students will focus on collecting details and disjointed facts and committing them to memory. If they can recollect enough, they will stay out of trouble.

Students who adopt a deep learning style will come to a lecture with previous knowledge and questions, will connect what is being thaught with that they alredy know and reflect on
on the significance of it. "They virtually teach themselves"

Does this apply to our apprentices too? ~ Meh writing

We want to get people to have deep knowledge of software development.
DIfferent kinds of learnings (unstructured, structured, multistructured, hierarchical, abstract) applied to code.
A parallel can be drawn to what solutions to problems come up with, what kind of problems do they see/expect (effort, structure, domain, business,...) and what strategies they can apply (effort, documentation, structure, tools, domain)

thinking this way made me realise we have to distinct problems that manifest:
* we have a spread of talent in the apprenticeship, but only a single curriculum
* our teaching, while personal and "high-touch", does not cater for learning styles - we currently don't guide people to higher forms of learning

HOW DOES THIS MATTER TO P2M
HOW DOES THIS IMPACT P2M? What changes? What is worth highlighting?

Understand that there are different learning styles coming into the apprenticeship.
Cover a range of exercise styles, aiming for high-level/active engagement rather than low-level/passive engagement.

There should be a range of exercises at various levels of enagement:
 * "just" building something specific
 * working towards a non-functional aspect, such as performance, scalability, domain-expressiveness
 * transferring knowledege to a new problem set (change language, change context,...)
 * relating to others


# Outputs, Outcomes, and Context

Maybe even impact?

A recurring complaint from the apprentices is that they don't know what is expected of them.
From my personal experience, I'd leave certain bits in the dark to have my apprentice figure out, maybe even stumble slighlty and learn to pick yourself back up.
For example underestimating the effort needed, or having to learn new things,...

The difficulty comes when the approach in working with exercises is carried forward without the mentor really understanding the outcome that is desired.

Exercises should as such state a few things very clearly:
* output: what tangible things the apprentice is expected to deliver. Maybe some tests, or some code, or a blog post, or a talk etc etc...
* outcome: What is the apprentice expected to *learn* from this.
  From J. Biggs, this is best expressed in verbs. This is where most of our effort as mentors should be in.
  Its perfectly fine (and expected!) for multiple exercises to have the same outcome, to allow for many differnet learning styles.
* context: Where does this exercise fit into? Ideally some work-related aspects, but could also be some grouping of exercises


# Individual, yet consistent
