Ever since I joined 8th Light 4 years ago as an apprentice, our apprenticeship has been chaning.
Someitmes it had to adapt to the needs of the mentor being on client site most of the week.
Or it had to adjust to the skills and talents the apprentices brought with them.
I have a few ideas to highlight learning outcomes, provide more structure, yet keep the apprenticeship individual.
And yes, this will bet yet-another-app.

# Perceived changes and new challenges

Before we go into I feel we could do better, it is important to understand some of the short comings that have been mentioned.

For apprentices a big issue is the anxiety due to uncertainty they face around the apprenticeship.
This revolves around questions like "Am I learning fast enough?" or "What are milestones I need to complete before my graduation?" and "What will I be doing next week?".
There is also uncertainty in the individual tasks and exercises they are asked to do.
I have often hear apprentices wondering what they should _really_ be getting from an exercise, or complaints that they don't _really_ know what they are supposed to do.
My hunch is that a degree of cargo culting from us mentors and a broader range of experiences (from career changers without programming background to professional engineers with 2-3 years experience) is reinforcing this feeling of anxiety.

For us mentors, life isn't any easier.
We need to balance the everyday client struggles with finding time and space to mentor their apprentice(s).
More and more of our mentors are now onsite at a client engagement and as such weekly check-ins are done either remotely, later in the day, or crammed into a busy Friday afternoon.
This leaves very little leeway to find the right exercise that will push and challenge the apprentices to gain new insights.
Unless there is some strong will, there is a good chance mentors will fall back to exercises and reading material from their own apprenticeship.
There is a current trend to try more "application centric" exercises rather than varying constraints on the same problem, and we should capitalize on these ideas.

# Explicit is the new implict!

During the apprenticeship, there are a few things we need to keep in balance:

* Everybody should have the same introduction into the company and apprenticeship.
  This includes things like getting an email address, signing into Slack, being introduced to everybody, and signing our employee handbook and code of conduct.

* Every apprentice is different, comes form a different background, and has a different trajectory.
  Realizing this means that we need to be able to tailor each apprenticeship to the apprentice and their learning style.

* We have a common, shared set of values that we want all our graduating crafters to live up to.
  Throughout their apprenticeship we need to ensure to instill these, no matter what path they take on.

A lot of this _implicit_ today.
For example, it takes apprentices weeks to appear on our website, because its considered more of a side-task of... the mentors? the apprentice?
Or the purpose of having apprentices write blog posts is mostly implied. Sometimes its to improve the writing skills, sometimes its to emulate client communication, and often its
to allow the mentor gain insight into the apprentices thinking.

The best way I can see this working is in making more and more of the apprenticeship explict, somehow codefied.
The trick will be to make it codified, but flexible.
Broadly applicable, but custom for each apprentice.


# The rough outine

The general idea is to codify the exercises we currently do ad-hoc into _modules_.
These _modules_ will provide a fairly rigid structure in how they represented to the apprentices.
The rigid structure is intented to both make each module more predictable (repretition helps!) and to force us mentors to think about certain teaching aspects (mentioned later) and make them _explicit_.

At the beginning of the apprenticeship there would be a set of modules that are predefined and are the same for all apprentices.
These form a kind of tutorial, gradually introducing our values, tools, and processes. And cirtically: ensuring all our bases are covered.
This would be the place where we ensure the apprentice has all the tools, is aware of the critical processes, and knows about the shared goal and values of the apprenticeship.

Following on from the initial tutorial, the mentor and apprentice will be presented with a buffet-like set of modules _they can choose from_ to tackle.
This is where the individual apprenticeship emerges. The apprentie can look around spot things they'd be keen on trying, while the mentor can fall back on a larger pool exercises.


# For the mentors

Form the above things, there are a few things that I'd like to tackle from a mentor perspective, that in my view are low-hanging fruit.
The initial steps into the apprenticeship should made expl

# For apprenices

I think the biggest gain for apprentices from creating this path is less anxiety.
It's hard to know where you stand when there is no real finish line, other than a magical date with _"challenges"_ attached to it. 
A path that you can come back to, to see what you have accomplished and relate back to is just as valuable as a broad overview of what is coming ahead.

{{< figure src="/images/your-path.jpg" caption="Your path, where you came from and what is ahead" >}}

The structure of each module shoudl also help apprentices better understand what is expected of them, without giving away solutions.
The expectation is set by very explicitly stating two things on each module:

* the output: what tangible things the apprentice is expected to deliver. Maybe some features, or some specifc code, or a blog post, or a talk etc etc...
* the leraning outcome: What is the apprentice expected to *learn* from this module. These should be expressed in high-level verbs and relate to our values and principles.

These outputs and outcomes is where most of our effort as mentors should be in.

{{< figure src="/images/current-step.jpg" caption="Outputs and outcomes as part of learning module" >}}

Its perfectly fine (and expected!) for multiple exercises to have the same outcome, to allow for many differnet learning styles.


# Outputs, Outcomes, and Learning styles

Having multiple different modules cover the same output at different levels will allow mentors to select the right tasks (and their order) 
to give an apprentice the hightest chance of success.
This is particularly important, when we consider that we have apprenices with varying degrees of prior experience.
There is a very interesting SOLO Taxonomy from John B. Biggs and Kevin F. Collings ![book](https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&lr=&id=xUO0BQAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=Evaluating+the+Quality+of+Learning:+The+SOLO+Taxonomy&ots=aplyiVHpHa&sig=ByFlHTwvUQMWVEBWF_TfyLx11mE#v=onepage&q=Evaluating%20the%20Quality%20of%20Learning%3A%20The%20SOLO%20Taxonomy&f=false) that 
describes different levels of learning outcomes.
Attached to each of the 5 levels are a series of verbs such as "identify", "enumerate", "describe", "compare", "relate", "generalise", or "hypothesise".
Each of the level represents an increasing form of learning, from "Unistructural" all the way up to "Extended abstract"

{{< figure src="/images/solo-hierarchy.jpg" caption="SOLO hierarchy showing differnet levels of learning" >}}

Having defined _outputs_ on tasks will make it easier for apprentices with a tendency for a surface-learning style to understand what they need to deliver.
Making the module _outcomes_ explicit will encourage apprenices with a deep-learning tendency to connect the current module other modules and existing knowledge.
Explicit _outcomes_ will also allow apprentice with less experience to latch onto a common thread (e.g. refactorable code, or expressive tests) across multiple modules.

The challenge is see for us mentors here will be in connecting our exercises with clear outcomes that are expressed as some of our high-level principles and values.

# Embedding it in our culutre

A tool that does not find its niche in our existing culture will last more than a few days.
So its worth me theorising how _Path 2 Mastery_ would fit into our current landscape.
I don't think it should replace Artisan, writing and estimating stories, or Zagakus.
All three of these play a key role in instilling our values and keeping our apprenticeship closely resembling client work (stores + estimating).
The way I imagine the workflow would be to break a module into multiple stories in Artisan during the apprenticeship and marking a module as done when both mentor and apprentice agree
that the outputs have been delivered and the outcomes shown.
There is enough wiggle-room there to allow the pair to individualise as needed.
