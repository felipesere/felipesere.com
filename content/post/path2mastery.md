Ever since I joined 8th Light 4 years ago as an apprentice, our apprenticeship has been chaning.
Someitmes it had to adapt to the needs of the mentor being on client site most of the week.
Or it had to adjust to the skills and talents the apprentices brought with them.
I have a few ideas to highlight learning outcomes, provide more structure, yet keep the apprenticeship individual.
And yes, this will bet yet-another-app.

# Perceived changes and new challenges

Before we go into I feel we could do better, it is important to understand some of the short comings that have been mentioned.

For apprentices a big issue is the anxiety due to uncertainty they face around the apprenticeship.
This revolves around questions like "Am I learning fast enough?" or "What are milestones I need to complete before my graduation?" and "What will I be doing next week?".
There is also uncertainty in the individual tasks and exercises they are asked to do.
I have often hear apprentices wondering what they should _really_ be getting from an exercise, or complaints that they don't _really_ know what they are supposed to do.
My hunch is that a degree of cargo culting from us mentors and a broader range of experiences (from career changers without programming background to professional engineers with 2-3 years experience) is reinforcing this feeling of anxiety.

For us mentors, life isn't any easier.
We need to balance the everyday client struggles with finding time and space to mentor their apprentice(s).
More and more of our mentors are now onsite at a client engagement and as such weekly check-ins are done either remotely, later in the day, or crammed into a busy Friday afternoon.
This leaves very little leeway to find the right exercise that will push and challenge the apprentices to gain new insights.
Unless there is some strong will, there is a good chance mentors will fall back to exercises and reading material from their own apprenticeship.
There is a current trend to try more "application centric" exercises rather than varying constraints on the same problem, and we should capitalize on these ideas.

# Explicit is the new implict!

During the apprenticeship, there are a few things we need to keep in balance:

* Everybody should have the same introduction into the company and apprenticeship.
  This includes things like getting an email address, signing into Slack, being introduced to everybody, and signing our employee handbook and code of conduct.

* Every apprentice is different, comes form a different background, and has a different trajectory.
  Realizing this means that we need to be able to tailor each apprenticeship to the apprentice and their learning style.

* We have a common, shared set of values that we want all our graduating crafters to live up to.
  Throughout their apprenticeship we need to ensure to instill these, no matter what path they take on.

A lot of this _implicit_ today.
For example, it takes apprentices weeks to appear on our website, because its considered more of a side-task of... the mentors? the apprentice?
Or the purpose of having apprentices write blog posts is mostly implied. Sometimes its to improve the writing skills, sometimes its to emulate client communication, and often its
to allow the mentor gain insight into the apprentices thinking.

The best way I can see this working is in making more and more of the apprenticeship explict, somehow codefied.
The trick will be to make it codified, but flexible.
Broadly applicable, but custom for each apprentice.


# The rough outine

The general idea is to codify the exercises we currently do ad-hoc into _modules_.
These _modules_ will provide a fairly rigid structure in how they represented to the apprentices.
The rigid structure is intented to both make each module more predictable (repretition helps!) and to force us mentors to think about certain teaching aspects (mentioned later) and make them _explicit_.

At the beginning of the apprenticeship there would be a set of modules that are predefined and are the same for all apprentices.
These form a kind of tutorial, gradually introducing our values, tools, and processes. And cirtically: ensuring all our bases are covered.
This would be the place where we ensure the apprentice has all the tools, is aware of the critical processes, and knows about the shared goal and values of the apprenticeship.

Following on from the initial tutorial, the mentor and apprentice will be presented with a buffet-like set of modules _they can choose from_ to tackle.
This is where the individual apprenticeship emerges. The apprentie can look around spot things they'd be keen on trying, w



# For the mentors

Form the above things, there are a few things that I'd like to tackle from a mentor perspective, that in my view are low-hanging fruit.

# Surface learning vs Deep learning

(_John Biggs_)
People develop different learning styles
There are two broad learning styles, surface and deep learning.

Students who adopt a surface learning style study to earn a qualification for a job, putting in sufficient effort to pass an exam and stay out of trouble.
These students will focus on collecting details and disjointed facts and committing them to memory. If they can recollect enough, they will stay out of trouble.

Students who adopt a deep learning style will come to a lecture with previous knowledge and questions, will connect what is being thaught with that they alredy know and reflect on
on the significance of it. "They virtually teach themselves"

Does this apply to our apprentices too? ~ Meh writing

We want to get people to have deep knowledge of software development.
DIfferent kinds of learnings (unstructured, structured, multistructured, hierarchical, abstract) applied to code.
A parallel can be drawn to what solutions to problems come up with, what kind of problems do they see/expect (effort, structure, domain, business,...) and what strategies they can apply (effort, documentation, structure, tools, domain)

thinking this way made me realise we have to distinct problems that manifest:
* we have a spread of talent in the apprenticeship, but only a single curriculum
* our teaching, while personal and "high-touch", does not cater for learning styles - we currently don't guide people to higher forms of learning

HOW DOES THIS MATTER TO P2M
HOW DOES THIS IMPACT P2M? What changes? What is worth highlighting?

Understand that there are different learning styles coming into the apprenticeship.
Cover a range of exercise styles, aiming for high-level/active engagement rather than low-level/passive engagement.

There should be a range of exercises at various levels of enagement:
 * "just" building something specific
 * working towards a non-functional aspect, such as performance, scalability, domain-expressiveness
 * transferring knowledege to a new problem set (change language, change context,...)
 * relating to others


# Outputs, Outcomes, and Context

Maybe even impact?

A recurring complaint from the apprentices is that they don't know what is expected of them.
From my personal experience, I'd leave certain bits in the dark to have my apprentice figure out, maybe even stumble slighlty and learn to pick yourself back up.
For example underestimating the effort needed, or having to learn new things,...

The difficulty comes when the approach in working with exercises is carried forward without the mentor really understanding the outcome that is desired.

Exercises should as such state a few things very clearly:
* output: what tangible things the apprentice is expected to deliver. Maybe some tests, or some code, or a blog post, or a talk etc etc...
* outcome: What is the apprentice expected to *learn* from this.
  From J. Biggs, this is best expressed in verbs. This is where most of our effort as mentors should be in.
  Its perfectly fine (and expected!) for multiple exercises to have the same outcome, to allow for many differnet learning styles.
* context: Where does this exercise fit into? Ideally some work-related aspects, but could also be some grouping of exercises


# Individual, yet consistent
